# Pause 1 - output of this code

print(3 * 3 + 3 / 3 - 3)
# play computer - my answer is 7
# actual answer is 7.0 (note floating point due to "/" division)

# Pause 2 - change the code to output "3"

print(3 * (3 + 3) / 3 - 3)
# added parentheses around "3 + 3" to prioritize and create 18/3 which is then subtraced by 3 to output 3
