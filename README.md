This is my repo to collect my python learning journey, as well as use it to experiment and learn about git.
100DaysSuppDoc will contain various pdfs and resources that were provided as links during the lessons.
Projects after Day 15 are created from fresh projects as opposed to being borne from the 100 Days lesson environment for PyCharm
